# Boring Reddit

Boring Reddit is a front end app that fetches data from Reddit's API to provide users a less distracting way to use Reddit

It uses a simple design and comes with features that allow users to limit the amount of time they spend using the app. Users can not post to Reddit; they can only read

## Features
1. Search for subreddits
2. You can limit the number of threads you see
3. Turn off comments
4. NSFW filter

## Technologies
1. Node.js
2. React
3. Redux
4. Bootstrap
5. Jest

## Future Work
1. More options to limit content that is seen
2. A time limit set by the user
